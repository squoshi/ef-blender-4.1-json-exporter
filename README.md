# Epic Fight Animation & Model exporter
This is my Blender `>2.8` fork of the Epic Fight Mod Blender export add-on originally written by [Yesman](https://github.com/Yesssssman).     
Blender `2.79` and below used python2 syntax. From `2.8` onwards they moved to python3 and had some changes in the API.      
Tested on Blender `2.8`, `3.6`, `4.0.1` and `4.1.1`. 
Should not have any issues on future versions unless the Blender API changes drastically or python4 is released.  
It will ignore exporting IK bones to prevent errors, so best to bake your animation and play it before you export it.

## Installation
1. Download the release.
2. Import it to Blender through Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install... > Select the .zip file
3. Make sure the add-on is enabled.
4. File > Export > menu should now contain `Animated Minecraft Model(.json)`

## Support
I'm in the [EFM discord server](https://discord.com/invite/NbAJwj8RHg) > Epic Fight Animation files thread is pinned in the #forums channel. Do not ask metal or Yesman for support for this version of the script.
